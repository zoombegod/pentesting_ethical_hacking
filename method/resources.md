## Linux

### [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.
The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused to get the phuq break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.
It is important to note that this is not a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOBins is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain binaries available.
GTFOBins is a collaborative project created by Emilio Pinna and Andrea Cardaci where everyone can contribute with additional binaries and techniques.


## Windows

### [WADComs](https://wadcoms.github.io/)
WADComs is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a curated list of offensive security tools and their respective commands, to be used against Windows/AD environments.
If you hate constantly looking up the right command to use against a Windows or Active Directory environment (like me), this project should help ease the pain a bit. Just select what information you currently have related to the Windows machine (passwords, usernames, services, etc.), and it will display a list of tools you can try against the machine, along with a template command for easy copy/pasting. See the full list of items and filters.
This project was created by John Woodman and was inspired by [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)

### [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)
The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.
A LOLBin/Lib/Script must: 
- Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft
- Have extra "unexpected" functionality
- Exceptions are application whitelisting bypasses
- Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team


## Other / Mixed

Here you will find privilege escalation tools for Windows and Linux/Unix* and MacOS.
These tools search for possible local privilege escalation paths that you could exploit and print them to you with nice colors so you can recognize the misconfigurations easily.
