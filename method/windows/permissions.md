Privilege 	Group/local security policy 	Description 	Practical attack 	Tool
SeCreateTokenPrivilege 	Create a token object 	Allows a process to create an access token by calling NtCreateToken() or other token token-creating APIs. 	? 	?
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege 	Replace a process-level token 	Allows a parent process to replace the access token that is associated with a child process. 	Attacker exploits an application that has an impersonation token and uses it to spawn another process as the impersonated user. 	Incognito, Churrasco
SeLockMemoryPrivilege 	Lock pages in memory 	Allows a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the system from paging data to virtual memory on disk. Assigning this privilege can result in significant degradation of system performance. 	? 	?
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege 	Increase quotas 	Allows a process that has Write Property access to another process to increase the processor quota that is assigned to the other process. This privilege is useful for system tuning, but it can be abused, as in a denial of service attack. 	? 	?
SeUnsolicitedInputPrivilege 	? 	Required to read unsolicited input from a terminal device. It is obsolete and unused. it has no effect on the system. 	? 	?
SeMachineAccountPrivilege 	Add workstations to the domain 	Allows a user to add a computer to a specific domain. For the privilege to be effective, it must be assigned to the user as part of local security policy for domain controllers in the domain. A user who has this privilege can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. 	? 	?
SeTcbPrivilege 	Act as part of the operating system 	This user right allows a process to impersonate any user without authentication. The process can therefore gain access to the same local resources as that user. 	? 	?
SeSecurityPrivilege 	Manage auditing and security log 	Determines which users can specify object access auditing options for individual resources such as files, Active Directory objects, and registry keys. 	? 	?
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege 	Take ownership of files or other objects?

SeSystemtimePrivilege 	Change the system time 	Allows the user to set the time for the internal clock of the computer. 	? 	?
SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege 	Profile a single process 	Allows a user to run Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 performance monitoring tools to monitor the performance of nonsystem processes. 	? 	?
SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege 	Increase scheduling priority 	Allows a process that has Write Property access to another process to increase the execution priority of the other process. 	? 	?
SeCreatePagefilePrivilege 	Create a pagefile 	Allows the user to create and change the size of a pagefile. 	? 	?
SeCreatePermanentPrivilege 	Create permanent shared objects 	Allow a process to create a directory object in the Windows 2000 object manager. This privilege is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the Windows 2000 object namespace. Components that are running in kernel mode already have this privilege; it is not necessary to assign it to them. 	? 	?
SeBackupPrivilege 	Backup files and directories 	Allows the user to circumvent file and directory permissions to backup the system. The privilege is selected only when the application attempts to access through the NTFS backup application interface. Otherwise normal file and directory permissions apply. 	Copy files 	NSCopy
SeRestorePrivilege 	Restore files and directories 	Allows a user to circumvent file and directory permissions when restoring backed-up files and directories and to set any valid security principal as the owner of an object. 	Change permissions, probably over write too 	SetOwner
SeShutdownPrivilege 	Shutdown the system 	Allows a user to shut down the local computer. 	n/a 	n/a
SeDebugPrivilege 	Debug programs 	Allows the user to attach a debugger to any process. 	Manipulate processes 	Incognito, debugger
SeAuditPrivilege 	Generate security audits 	Allows a process to generate entries in the security log. The security log is used to trace unauthorized system access and other security relevant activities. 	? 	?
SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege 	Modify firmware environment values 	Allows modification of system environment variables either by a process through an API or by a user through the System Properties applet. 	Change where things get run from, brick the system 	Bricks Samsung laptops
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege 	Bypass traverse checking 	Allows the user to pass through folders to which the user otherwise has no access while navigating an object path in any Microsoft Windows file system or in the Registry. This privilege does not allow the user to list the contents of a folder; it allows the user only to traverse its directories. 	? 	?
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege 	Force shutdown from a remote system 	Allows a user to shut down a computer from a remote location on the network. 	n/a 	n/a
SeUndockPrivilege 	Remove computer from docking station 	Allows a user of a portable computer to unlock the computer by clicking Eject PC on the Start menu. 	n/a 	n/a
SeSyncAgentPrivilege 	Synchronize directory service data 	Allows a service to provide directory synchronization services. This privilege is relevant only on Domain Controllers. Required for a domain controller to use the LDAP directory synchronization services. This privilege enables the holder to read all objects and properties in the directory, regardless of the protection on the objects and properties. 	? 	?
SeEnableDelegationPrivilege 	Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation 	Allows the user to change the Trusted for Delegation setting on a user or computer in Active Directory. The user or computer that is granted this privilege must also have write access to the account control flag on the object. 	? 	?
SeManageVolumePrivilege 	Perform volume maintenance tasks 	This security setting determines which users and groups can run maintenance tasks on a volume, such as remote defragmentation. Use caution when assigning this user right. Users with this user right can explore disks and extend files in to memory that contains other data. When the extended files are opened, the user might be able to read and modify the acquired data. 	? 	?
SeImpersonatePrivilege 	Impersonate a client after authentication 	Assigning this privilege to a user allows programs running on behalf of that user to impersonate a client. Requiring this user right for this kind of impersonation prevents an unauthorized user from convincing a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created and then impersonating that client, which can elevate the unauthorized user’s permissions to administrative or system levels. 	Basically if you can run code under any service in Win2k3 then you can own Windows, this is because Windows services accounts can impersonate. Other process (not services) that can impersonate are IIS 6 worker processes so if you can run code from an ASP.net or classic ASP web application then you can own Windows too. If you provide shared hosting services then it is recommended that users are not permitted to run this kind of code from ASP. 	Churrasco, Incognito
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege 	Create global objects 	This user right is required for a user account to create global objects during Terminal Services sessions. Users can still create session-specific objects without being assigned this user right. 	? 	?
SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege (Vista+) 	Create symbolic links 	This privilege is required to create a symbolic link. 	There have been a number of vulnerabilities which are exploitable through the manipulation of system objects such as files and registry keys using symbolic links. Notably, this included MS10-021, 	?
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege (Vista+) 	Increase a process working set 	This user right allows a user to allocate more memory for applications that run in the context of users. 	? 	?
SeRelabelPrivilege (Vista+) 	Modify an object label 	This privilege is required by users to modify the mandatory integrity level of an object. 	? 	?
SeTimeZonePrivilege (Vista+) 	Change the time zone 	This user right is required to allow the user to change the timezone. 	? 	?
