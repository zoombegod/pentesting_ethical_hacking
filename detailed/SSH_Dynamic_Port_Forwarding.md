sudo ssh -N -D 127.0.0.1:813 user@ownedIP
```

direct tools to use proxy with **ProxyChains**

```
/etc/proxychains4.conf
socks4     127.0.0.1 813
```

**To run through our SOCKS4 proxy prepend each command with proxychains**

```
sudo vim /etc/proxychains4.conf
sudo proxychains nmap 
```

- ProxyChains will attempt to read its configuration file first from the current directory
- then from $(HOME)/.proxychainsdirectory
- and then from /etc/proxychains4.conf
- This allows tools through multiple dynamic tunnels
